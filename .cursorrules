# Cursor Rules

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Use ES modules (import/export) syntax
- Use `yarn dlx` instead of `npx` for executing packages
- Prefer `yarn` over `npm` for package management
- Use `/* */` style comments instead of `//` comments

## File Organization
- Keep source files in `src/` directory
- Keep test files alongside source files with `.test.ts` extension
- Keep build scripts in `scripts/` directory
- Keep configuration files in root directory

## Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case for file names
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants

## Code Quality
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use descriptive variable names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Prefer composition over inheritance

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Use Jest as the testing framework
- Aim for high test coverage
- Mock external dependencies

## Performance
- Optimize for readability over premature optimization
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Avoid blocking operations in main thread
- Profile before optimizing

## Security
- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Keep dependencies updated
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
